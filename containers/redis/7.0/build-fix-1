# For future reference, we modify this directly in the source instead of just supplying a default
# configuration flag because apparently "if you specify any argument to redis-server, 
# [it assumes] you are going to specify everything".
# See also https://github.com/docker-library/redis/issues/4#issuecomment-50780840
# (more exactly, this makes sure the default behavior of "save on SIGTERM" stays functional by default)
